<strong><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION:</b></strong>
<table width="650">
<tr>
<td>
This dataset contains the location of sampling points for the Florida Healthy Beaches Program.  The statewide testing program tests for enterococci, which the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recommended states adopt as a saltwater quality indicator. Enterococci are enteric bacteria that normally inhabit the intestinal tract of humans and animals.  The presence of enteric bacteria can be an indication of fecal pollution, which may come from stormwater runoff, pets and wildlife, and human sewage.  If they are present in high concentrations in recreational waters and are ingested while swimming or enter the skin through a cut or sore, they may cause human disease, infections or rashes.  This is an update to the beachwtr_may11.

In 1998, five of Florida's coastal counties began monitoring for enterococci
bacteria under a grant-funded pilot program. By the beginning of 2000, 11
Florida counties were participating in the program, which continued through
July 2000.

In August 2000, the Beach Water Sampling Program was extended to 30 of Florida's
coastal counties through state legislation (Senate Bill 1412 and House Bill 2145)
and funding. In addition, sampling under the new program now includes fecal
coliform as well as enterococci bacteria. The rationale for selecting these two
bacteria for analysis and implications of the sampling results are described below.
In August 2002, the beach water sampling program began collecting water samples
on a weekly basis with additional funding from U.S. EPA. The most recent results
from the current program can be reviewed here:

The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data
compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from
the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is
collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources)
who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in
FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the
data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees
about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check
with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist.

Furthermore, the GIS data available in the FGDL are provided 'as is'.
The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no warranties, guaranties
or representations as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of the data
provided by the data sources. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center
makes no representations or warranties about the quality or suitability
of the materials, either expressly or implied, including but not limited
to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, or non-infringement. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center
shall not be liable for any damages suffered as a result of using,
modifying, contributing or distributing the materials.

A note about data scale: 

Scale is an important factor in data usage.  Certain scale datasets
are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes.
Please be sure you are using the best available data. 

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
county level.
1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such
as property parcel boundaries.
1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
multi-county or regional level.
1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be
considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data
before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been
made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional
information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact
section of this documentation. For more information regarding
scale and accuracy, see our webpage at:

<pre>
GeoPlan took the following steps during the QA/QC Process:
 - Downloaded the dataset from FDOH on 10/31/2016 using this link:
   http://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/gis/gis-data.html
   (original dataset in shapefile format and in the WGS 1984 geographic
   coordinate system).
 - Dataset projected into the FGDL Albers HPGN projection and renamed.
 - DESCRIPT field added based on the SPLOCATION field.
 - FGDLAQDATE field added based on the date dataset was downloaded
   from source.
 - The longest record for each field was found and field character lengths
   were shortened to the appropriate shortest length possible.
 - Uppercased fields and records in the dataset.
