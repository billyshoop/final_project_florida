<td>
This dataset contains 2016 records of public lodging establishments (i.e., hotels, motels, rooming
houses, bed &amp; breakfasts, apartments, resort condominiums and resort dwellings) in the state
of Florida. The data used to create this layer was downloaded from the Florida Department of
Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) and only contains lodging facilities registered
with DBPR. This dataset contains fields denoting the physical address, number of units/rooms,
and contact information for lodging facilities in Florida. This data is meant to be used for
planning purposes only and is not intended to represent a 100% inventory of lodging facilities
in Florida. Lodging facility locations that have been verified are marked with the letter V in the FLAG field.
This dataset is an update to the GC_HOTELS_JUN11 layer.

The Department of Business and Professional Regulation is the agency charged
with licensing and regulating businesses and professionals in the State of
Florida, such as cosmetologists, veterinarians, real estate agents and pari-
mutual wagering facilities. Our mission is to license efficiently, regulate
fairly, and we strive to meet this goal in our day-to-day operation. The
Department is under the executive branch of the Governor and is governed by
Chapter 120, F.S. The Department is structured according to the requirements
of Section 20.165, F.S.

What is Geocoding?
Geocoding is term used to describe the act of address matching.  Geocoding
is the process of finding a geographic location (x, y point) for an address
(such as street number and name, city, state, and ZIP Code) on a map.
Geocoding is based off the typical address scheme for the US, in which one
side of the street contains even house numbers while the other side of the
street contains odd house numbers.

The geocoding process uses an algorithm to find the geographic location
of addresses. First, a street segment is identified using the zip code and
street name. Next, the geographic location of the address is matched using
the building number to determine how far down the street and on which side
of the street the building is located. Geocoding Accuracy

The locational accuracy of geocoded addresses may vary from urban to rural
areas due to the algorithm used to generate the geographic locations of
addresses. The algorithm assumes that the size of parcels are equivalent
along a road route. This assumption tends to be more consistent in urban
areas, where the size of parcels vary less than in rural areas.
Consequently, the results of geocoded addresses in urban areas are usually
more reliable than those in rural areas.

For example, the locational accuracy of rural addresses can be slightly
off because some parcels along a rural route may be 15 acres while others
may be 2.5 acres, but the geocoding algorithm assumes that the addresses
are distributed evenly along the route.<br /><br />

Under Chapter 119, Florida Statutes, the Department of Business and Professional
Regulation (DBPR) is required to make available for inspection and copying any
public record regardless of physical format, which is not otherwise exempted from
public access by general law. To fulfill this obligation, the DBPR provides copies
of electronic records to the public through free download.

DBPR is only required to provide data in the format in which it is maintained and,
as a result, does not provide paper copies of this information. In addition, the
DBPR is not required to reformat its records to meet a requestor's particular needs.

Section 119.01(2)(b), F.S., requires only that the agency provide electronic data
in some common format such as, but not limited to, the American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) text format. As, the download files provided by
DBPR are formatted as ASCII text, quote/comma delimited.</pre>

The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data
compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from
the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is
collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources)
who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in
FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the
data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees
about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check
with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist.

Furthermore, the GIS data available in the FGDL are provided 'as is'.
The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no warranties, guaranties
or representations as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of the data
provided by the data sources. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center
makes no representations or warranties about the quality or suitability
of the materials, either expressly or implied, including but not limited
to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, or non-infringement. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center
shall not be liable for any damages suffered as a result of using,
modifying, contributing or distributing the materials.

A note about data scale: 

Scale is an important factor in data usage.  Certain scale datasets
are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes.
Please be sure you are using the best available data. 

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
county level.
1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such
as property parcel boundaries.
1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
multi-county or regional level.
1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be
considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data
before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been
made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional
information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact
section of this documentation. For more information regarding
scale and accuracy, see our webpage at:

<pre>
GeoPlan Center Process Steps:

Lodging information was obtained from the Florida Department of Business
and Professional Regulation (DBPR) via their Lodging Public Records Site here:
http://www.myfloridalicense.com/dbpr/sto/file_download/public-records-lodging.html

Seven separate tables were downloaded representing different licensing 
and inspection districts across Florida in CSV format. These CSV files were
combined into one comprehensive file. There were 39390 records in the
combined table. This file was then exported to a DBF and geocoded using
a composite geocoder utilizing parcel data, navteq streets, and tiger roads.

After geocoding, the following steps were taken to process the results:
 - Points that were not matched to an address and had no spatial location
   were removed from the dataset, bringing the total record count to 35142.
 - Points that were matched using parcel data and which received a score
   of 100 were flagged as verified (V), all other records were flagged as not
   verified (NV). This information is found in the FLAG field which was
   added by GeoPlan.
 - This dataset was spatially joined with data from the 2015 parcels layer
   produced by GeoPlan, which can be found here: www.fgdl.org.
 - Multiple fields were moved around, removed, or added in order to meet
   the desired table structure for geocoded layers.
 - The FGDLAQDATE field was added based on the time GeoPlan
   acquired the data. The UPDATE_DAY field was added based on the
   date the data was updated by DBPR. The DESCRIPT field was added
   based on the NAME field.
 - All records were uppercased.

Basic information about the original tables downloaded from DBPR can
be seen below:
 - District 1, 7770 records
 - District 2, 5320 records
 - District 3, 7307 records
 - District 4, 10512 records
 - District 5, 2578 records
 - District 6, 3106 records
 - District 7, 2797 records
